Manga Download Script
========================

About
-----
Manga Download Scripts is a manga downloader similar to my old MangaFox Download Script. It works by scraping the image URL from every page in a manga chapter. It then it downloads all the images.
I was using MangaFox script but the images quality in MangaFox isn't good for me so I created this to download manga from MangaPanda. In the future I will improve this and I will try to add other sites.

Dependencies
------------

  * Python 2.7, 3.3
  * BeautifulSoup (``pip install beautifulsoup`` OR ``pip install beautifulsoup4``)

Tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS. It should work on any Linux, OS X, or Windows machine as long as the dependencies are installed.

Usage
-----
To download an entire series:

    ~ $ python script_name.py MANGA_NAME

To download all the chapters starting from a specific chapter

    ~ $ python script_name.py MANGA_NAME -s CHAPTER_NUMBER 

To download a specific chapter:

    ~ $ python script_name.py MANGA_NAME CHAPTER_NUMBER

To download a range of manga chapter:

    ~ $ python script_name.py MANGA_NAME RANGE_START RANGE_END

Notes
-----
Use this wisely and don't be evil.
